This is MESH model setup for Bow river at Banff.   
The setup is organized to test the effect of glacier albedo values on glacier flow contribution.  
The setup has five cases to test different aledo values and one case to test removal of glacier and replaced with barrenland see below:  
ALVSI   = Visible albedo of glacier  
ALIRI    = Infrared albedo of glacier  
Case 0 = 0.95(ALVSI), 0.73(ALIRI)  
Case 1 = 0.85(ALVSI), 0.56(ALIRI)  
Case 2 = 0.75(ALVSI), 0.50(ALIRI)  
Case 3 = 0.65(ALVSI), 0.43(ALIRI)  
Case 4 = 0.55(ALVSI), 0.36(ALIRI)  
Case 5 = 0.35(ALVSI), 0.23(ALIRI)  
Case 6 = Replaced glacier with barrenland  
The summary of results are available on the powerpoint file "Glacier albedo test_bow at Banff_1693_updated_param.pptx"  
The model forcing files are not included due to the large file size
